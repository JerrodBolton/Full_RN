## Big O!!

### What is Big O ?

- It a national ComputerS to describe the way something will performance. AS well as the complexity of an algorithm.

#### The best way to understand Big O as a coder you will needs some examples.

1. They gives examples on ways to understand this at
   [Big O Examples](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation)

In the Article they go on to talk about **Logarithms** which is something hard to explain so they added this example:

- Binary search is a technique used to search sorted data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the median, and compares it against a target value. If the values match, it will return success. If the target value is higher than the value of the probe element, it will take the upper half of the data set and perform the same operation against it. Likewise, if the target value is lower than the value of the probe element, it will perform the operation against the lower half. It will continue to halve the data set with each iteration until the value has been found or until it can no longer split the data set.

### What do this means?

- It means by using Binary
  data set we can search quickly and same time on the search of **Algorithms**.

- Remember this that [Big O](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs/8) can be scary, however we unpack this popular cs topic and show you how we can use it in the long run.
