# Readings: FileIO & Exceptions

## Read & Write Files in Python

This has a lot of information some here is the [Link](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python) to it.

- This is going to talk about all the info that will be important bout reading & write a file in a python.
- Let my start off by talking; bout what is a **_file_**?
  - At the contiguous set a bytes that stores data (A place to put all of your data)
  - They mostly have…
    1. Header… name, size & etc
    2. Data… the thing that you are talking about
    3. End of file…anything that you want to end a file of will
  - Now we will talk bout a **_file path_**
    - This is just talking about the way that i will get to the file that i want to get to.
    - This us mostly using a \*\*\*\* & the file name with the folder

## Exceptions in Python

This has a lot of information this is the [Link](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/) to it. Also in this article, I will see what an exception is and how it differs from a syntax error.

### Exception vs. Syntax Errors

- What is a Exception error?
  - This type of error occurs whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error.
- To get out of this error you can use..
  1. Raising an Exception (There is a **_condition_** )
  2. Make a AssertionError ( Don’t wait on the error)
  3. The [try](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/#the-try-and-except-block-handling-exceptions) and except Block: Handling Exceptions

  ```python
      - try:
      - linux_interaction()
      - except:
      - print('Linux function was not executed')
  ```

  ```python
     - Shell(Linux function was not executed)
  ```
  
- What is a Syntax Errors?
  - Syntax Errors occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement
